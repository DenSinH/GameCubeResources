### CPU

 - gamecube.pdf: someones architecture review about the Nintendo GameCube (pretty basic stuff, but a clear explanation on the pipeline. Not sure how useful for emulation).
 - gekko_user_manual.pdf: complete manual on the GameCube's processor.
 - gekko_user_manual-337-604 (instruction set).pdf: Excerpt from above, only containing the instruction manual.
 - PowerPC - Assembly IBM Programming Environment (general register info).pdf: general info in IBM processors and their registers. This info can not be found in the user manual (or at least, a very limited amount of it) so very useful as well.
